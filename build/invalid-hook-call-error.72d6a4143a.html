I ran the command <code>npm link</code> in the root folder of <strong>calendar-ui</strong> and <code>npm link calendar-ui</code> in the root folder of <strong>test-calendar</strong>. After doing it, in the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder there was another <strong>calendar-ui</strong> folder under the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder of <strong>test-calendar</strong></p><p><img src=https://www.vespaiach.com/images/two_projects.png alt=Calendar></p><p>When I started the <code>test-calendar</code> app, I got these error:</p><p><img src=https://www.vespaiach.com/images/invalid_hook_err.png alt="The error"></p><p>Obviously, the error said I was using React hook in the wrong way, but actually I didn’t. After spending a few hours researching and googling, I found on the official React page, there is <a href=https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html>an article</a> about the exact problem I was facing.</p><p>Ultimately, the problem was when running <code>npm link</code> it created a symbolic link that pointed to folder <strong>calendar-ui</strong> and noted that I placed the <strong>calendar-ui</strong> folder and the <strong>test-calendar</strong> folder directly under my <strong>dev</strong> folder which said they both have the same level. To be clear here, their node_modules folders had the same level. So when <strong>test-calendar</strong> app started, it used the React instance of <strong>calendar-ui</strong> for the <strong>calendar-ui</strong> component and it caused the mis-match and the error.</p><h2>The fix</h2><p>Basically, We can create another symbolic link of React module inside <strong>calendar-ui</strong> folder that points to React module of <strong>test-calendar</strong>, so that they both use the same React module. However, to make it easy, I simply deleted the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder of <strong>calendar-ui</strong> and everything worked fine.</p></article></div></body></html>
