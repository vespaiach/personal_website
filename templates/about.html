  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">About Me</h2>

  <div class="space-y-4">
    <p>
      I'm a software developer with many years of experience building websites/ web applications. I specialize in front-end
      development using JavaScript, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, but I also equally enjoy working on back-end tasks and solving
      system-level problems. My back-end toolkit includes Node.js, Ruby, PHP, and
      PostgresQL. Some frameworks I frequently use are React.js, Ruby on Rails, WordPress, and Express.js.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like figuring things outâ€”whether it's fixing layout bugs, improving performance, or troubleshooting environment
      setups. Problem solving and eager to learn new things are two things that keep me motivated and moving forward. I take a
      thoughtful, hands-on approach to challenges and enjoy exploring different ways to make things work better.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">About this site</h2>

  <p>
    I decided to not bind this site to any specific framework or deployment platform, and instead build it my own way just using
    HTML and Tailwind CSS
    for styling, and setup a simple development environment with Node.js for generating static files and Overmind tool for running
    the
    development server
    and managing the build process. I also use a custom script to generate the structured data for the pages, which is important
    for SEO and
    improving the visibility of my content in search engines. You can find the source code for this site on my <a
       href="https://github.com/vespaiach/personal_website">GitHub.</a></p>
