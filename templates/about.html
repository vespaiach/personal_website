  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <div class="space-y-4">
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Trinh Nguyen and I'm a software developer focused on building websites/ web applications. I specialize in
      front-end
      development using modern web technologies, but I also equally enjoy working on back-end tasks and solving
      system-level problems.</p>

    <p>
      I like figuring things outâ€”whether it's fixing bugs, improving performance, integrating complex systems, or troubleshooting
      environment
      setups. Problem solving and eager to learn new things are two things that keep me motivated and moving forward. I take a
      thoughtful, hands-on approach to challenges and enjoy exploring different ways to make things work better.
    </p>

    <p>My development toolkit includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Front-end: Typescript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, Vite.js, Esbuild</li>
      <li>Back-end: Ruby, Node.js, PHP, PostgresQL</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Some frameworks I frequently use to build websites/ web applications are: React.js, Ruby on Rails, WordPress, and
      Express.js.</p>

  <h1>About this site</h1>

  <p>I am building this site to share my knowledge and experiences on my journey as a software developer.</p>

  <p>This site is not using any specific framework or deploying on a special platforms, instead it was built as static sites just using HTML and Tailwind CSS for styling, and I set up a simple development environment with Node.js for generating static files and Overmind tool for running the development server and managing the build process. You can find the source code for this site on my <a
       href="https://github.com/vespaiach/personal_website">GitHub.</a></p>
